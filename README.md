PythonClient
============

PythonClient is a test solution for binding AutoCAD .NET automation with a Python sockets server.

We use ZeroMQ to pass messages between .NET client and Python information modeling server.

This is a further development of Shadowbinder.py ecosystem, an experiment in opensource structural model processing for the AEC industry.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: this is not a release and not even an alpha version. The project is in early stages of development.
